PaperRace
=========

Simple game we used to play in school. I thought it might be a nice project to play around with a framework like [https://www.pygame.org/](PyGame) (turned out [https://pyglet.org/](PyGlet) seems to be the better choice in terms of performance) and simple game agents.

It's really not in a usable stage and only meant to play around with graphical interface and agents.
